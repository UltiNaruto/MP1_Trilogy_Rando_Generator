# MP1_Trilogy_Rando_Generator
Generate a randomized ISO using BashPrime's Randomizer (https://github.com/etaylor8086/metroid-prime-randomizer/releases/latest) from a Metroid Prime Trilogy NTSC-U ISO

# Usage
First generate a template ISO using Metroid Prime Trilogy NTSC-U ISO and Metroid Prime NTSC 0-00.<br/>
/!\ It can take up to 10 mins on a 5400 RPM HDD so please be patient.<br/>
Then click on "Locate BashPrime's Randomizer" and search for the executable of BashPrime's Randomizer.<br/>
Then click on "Randomize". It will open BashPrime's Randomizer.<br/>
Setup the preset as you want. (Although some tricks can't be performed on Trilogy, ex: infinite speed, dashing, underwater slope jump)<br/>
To generate the needed informations for the output ISO you need to click on "Generate With Spoilers".<br/>
/!\ Do not change any settings when saving the ISO!<br/>
Save both spoiler and ISO then quit.<br/>
If you have deleted tmp/wii, it will ask you to reextract the Trilogy ISO.<br/>
It will open an Extract GC ISO window. Wait for it to finish.<br/>
Then it will ask you where to put the output ISO. (It will also copy the spoiler if you checked Save Spoiler earlier)<br/>
The ISO is now generated. Have fun!<br/>

Note : You need to locate BashPrime's Randomizer just once as it's saved in a config after doing so. The same goes for generating the template ISO.<br/>
Note 2 : You can delete tmp folder if you want but you should keep it so it doesn't need to reextract the Metroid Prime Trilogy ISO everytime.<br/>
Note 3 : You need 18 GB or more of free space where this program is placed because it keeps stuff in the tmp folder mentioned above.<br/>
Note 4 : You can't use Progressive option for Suit Damage Reduction yet. It's planned to be supported later though.

# FAQ
Q: May I put any tricks I want?<br/>
A: As long as it doesn't involve doing infinite speed. However some tricks aren't working. Please refer to our blacklist of tricks.

Q: There's a logic bug, can you fix it?<br/>
A: If it is because of an enabled trick, make sure to open an issue saying which trick you were expected to do in which room.<br/>
That doesn't mean I will fix it but at least we can figure out which tricks not to enable on Trilogy. Don't bother BashPrime to fix it, his randomizer wasn't made to work on Trilogy at first.

Q: I got softlocked. What do I do?<br/>
A: BashPrime's Randomizer contains a FAQ about softlocks. Make sure to check it before starting to play.

Q: Will you support Metroid Prime Trilogy PAL/NTSC-J?<br/>
A: I do intend to add the support for them. But it will take time before I do so. For the time being you will need the NTSC-U version.

Q: Will you support Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes?<br/>
A: I don't intend on doing so. If you want to play it on Trilogy, wait for Randovania to support it natively.
